This is a test for a windowmanager I started. I use it to learn the 
functionality of the xcb library and to play with some of the C++11 
features. I tries to keep a clean codebase, but since I haven't any 
experience with xcb (and X in general) yet, it may be a bit messy 
sometimes.

The idea is to develop a manual tiling wm with support for window 
tabbing (and maybe stacking). Navigation should work with both hand on 
keyboard as well with one hand on the keyboard one on the mouse, at v
least for the basic features (moving and resizing windows, etc.)

I would like to implement compositing, but that's something for later.

Inspirations for that wm come from i3 and herbstluftwm. I use mcwm and 
i3 as references for the (poorly documented) xcb library.
